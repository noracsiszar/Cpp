C++ Projects

# C++ Project number 1: Ccy converter.
The currency converter asks the user to input the amount of
- EURs
- CHFs
- GBPs
  the user has, along with the exchange rates for
  - EUR_USD
  - CHF_USD
  - and GBP_USD
and splits out the equivalent amount in US$.

# C++ Project number 2: GPA calculator
The GPA calculator calculates the GPA of a student for a semester for 3 courses (mathematics, biology and physics) based on:
- grades from A+ to F
- and ECTS points
- The user defines the grades on a range from A+ to F and the ECTS points
- the total GPA is calculated by the formula of
     
  GPA = ((math_ects * math_grade_in_numbers)  + (biology_ects * biology_grade_in_numbers)  + (physics_ects * physics_grade_in_numbers))/(math_ects+biology_ects+physics_ects);

# C++ Project number 3: RockpaperScissor game
One round of RockpaperScissor game:
- The user chooses Rock, Paper or Scissor and
- the computer chooses a random of the three (corresponding to a random number).
- an If loop compares user input with random computer number and splits out the text who won/lost.

# C++ Project number 4: Using function incl. a loop
Let us solve a simple problem:
- We are given 3 lines of input.
- Each line consists of 2 space separated integers - A and B
- For each input - you need to compute and output the following on separate lines: 
  - A + B
  - A^2 + 2*AB + B^2

# C++ Project number 5: The Fahrenheit Celsius converter using functions
- The user enters the direction he wants to convert based on the printed out menu.
- The user enters the amount of grade he wants to convert.
- The result gets printed out to the console.

# C++ Project number 6: The product purchase price calculator using functions
- The purchase price calculation for a product is based on Listenpreis (list price), der Menge (quantity), dem Skonto (discount), dem Rabatt (discount2) und den Versandkosten (shipping costs)
- The user enters the all variables, the discounts in %.
- The result gets printed out to the console.

# C++ Project number 7: Tic Tac Toe.
- The user decides who starts the game (The user or the computer).
- Grid 3x3 is drawn and defined by rows and columns
- Game ends with draw or win or lose.

# C++ Project number 8: Calculator.
- Calculator printed out to the console
- User choosing number1, number2
- User choosing operation +,-,*,/
- Calculator printing out the result to the console
- Calculator asking user for new input as long as user would like to perform a new calculation (while break loop)

# C++ Project number 9: Random number guessing game between 0-9.
- The computer generates a random number between 0-9.
- The user keeps guessing until he/she didn't guess right.
