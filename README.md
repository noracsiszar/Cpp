C++ Project number2: GPA calculator
The GPA calculator calculates the GPA of a student for a semester for 3 courses (mathematics, biology and physics) based on:
- grades from A+ to F
- and ECTS points
- The user defines the grades on a range from A+ to F and the ECTS points
- the total GPA is calculated by the formula of
  GPA = ((math_ects * math_grade_in_numbers) 
+ (biology_ects * biology_grade_in_numbers) 
+ (physics_ects * physics_grade_in_numbers))/(math_ects+biology_ects+physics_ects);
